- The debt ratio shows that both firms have depended on debts to fund their operation rather than using their equity. 
Although the current ratio demonstrates that both General Motors and Ford Motors can deal with their short-term 
obligation; in the long term, it can lead to risk. The analysis of the efficiency ratio shows that the two corporations 
may face difficulty in selling their inventory. Also, the data for both firms was lower than the industry average and 
had a downward trend from 2021 to 2023. This may come from the rise of new competitors in the automotive industry. 
Thus; in conclusion, the investor should not invest in these companies in the short term.
